# Code Updates for Milestone M29

The following logic adjustments and cleanups were applied based on the previous audit in `NOT_LOGICAL.md`.

## Shared IndexedDB Helper
- Created `frontend/src/utils/indexedDb.ts` which exports `openCredentialDB`.
- `credentialVault.ts` and `encryption.ts` now import and use this helper instead of having separate implementations.

## Comment and Import Cleanup
- Clarified the comment for `PBKDF2_ITERATIONS` in `encryption.ts`.
- Removed unused `querystring` import from `backend/ipc/oauthServer.ts`.
- Removed unsupported `userDataDir` option from Playwright context creation.

## Documentation Updated
- Updated `NOT_LOGICAL.md` to reflect resolved issues.

## Areas for Cursor Review
1. Ensure `openCredentialDB` correctly handles upgrade scenarios when future stores or versions are added.
2. Review Playwright automation for any other unsupported parameters or missing error handling.
3. Verify encryption key storage and retrieval still work after switching to the shared IndexedDB helper.
