# Outstanding Tasks / Tool Limitations

This file documents commands that were attempted but could not be completed within the container environment.

## Failed Test Execution

- Command: `npm test`
- Result: `Missing script: "test"`
- Reason: The project does not define a root-level `test` script.

## Frontend Tests

- Command: `cd frontend && npm test -- -w 1`
- Result: `react-scripts: not found`
- Reason: Dependencies for running React tests are not installed in the offline environment.

## Linting Attempt

- Command: `npm run lint`
- Result: `Missing script: "lint"`
- Reason: No lint script exists at the repository root.

## Additional Notes

To fully validate the project, ensure all dependencies are installed and consider adding standard `lint` and `test` scripts. Running these commands in a local development environment or a CI pipeline with network access should succeed.
